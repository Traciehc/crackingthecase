Welcome back. This is level five, section two, Scary Shorthand, and we're going to be talking about grouping multiple properties into a single property. The flex shorthand property is used to set values for flex‑grow, flex‑shrink, and flex‑basis. It defaults to 0 1 auto based on the defaults of the grow, shrink, and basis properties. Before we go any further with these, the one thing I will say is if you have to support older IE, you may want to avoid shorthand. It's where you'll see the most inconsistencies among the browsers. In using shorthand, you're not always going to want to set all three values. If you see flex with a single numerical value, that's declaring the flex‑grow property and leaving the defaults for flex‑shrink and flex‑basis. If you see flex with two numerical values, that's setting the flex‑grow and flex‑shrink properties and leaving flex‑basis to its default. If you see flex with a single numerical value and a measurement, like pixels or percentages, that is assigning the flex‑grow and the flex‑basis and leaving shrink to its default. And finally, if you see a flex with none, that's going to set the flex‑shrink to 0 and leave the others as default, thereby treating the item like it's not a flex item at all. The flex‑flow shorthand property is used to set values for flex‑direction and flex‑wrap. The default is row nowrap based on the direction and wrap properties. Much like the flex shorthand, you will see these with single values, and if you see flex‑flow with just column, that's setting the direction and leaving wrap to its default. If you see it with just a value of wrap, that's setting the flex‑wrap value and leaving the flex‑direction to its default. Congratulations on reaching the end of the course. To wrap things up, you're going to use shorthand in the challenges.
